# React Native Tor
A fully featured Tor Daemon , Onion Routing Client and Hidden Service HTTP server for your React Native iOS and Android Project!
:calling: :closed_lock_with_key: :globe_with_meridians:
## TL;DR
In your project:

```shell script
npm i react-native-tor
// for ios builds
npx pod-install
```

then
```js
import Tor from "react-native-tor";

// Initialize the module
const tor = Tor();

//...

const makeTorRequest = async()=>{
    // Start the daemon and socks proxy (no need for Orbot and yes iOS supported!)
    await tor.startIfNotStarted();

    try{
       // Use built in client to make REST calls to .onion urls routed through the Sock5 proxy !
       const resp = await tor.get('http://some.onion',{'Authorization': 'sometoken'});
       // Note: self signed https endpoints, custom headers and multiform/json payloads supported!
       await tor.post('https://someother.onion',JSON.stringify(resp.json),{'Authorization': 'sometoken'},true);
    } catch(error){
      // Catch a network or server error like you normally with any other fetch library
    }
}

makeTorRequest();
```
:boom:

If you think this is awesome, please consider [contributing to Privacy and Opensource](#Contributing-to-Privacy-and-Opensource) !

## Highlights
- Embeds a fully functional Tor Daemon, with its own circuit (non exit) removing the dependency on Orbot and allowing Tor usage on IOS.
- Provides a Socks5 proxy enabled REST client to allow you to make Rest calls on Onion URLs directly from JS just as you would with Axios, Frisbee etc..
- Tcp socket support via a event like interface!
- Start a hidden service and HTTP server accessible via an Onion URL directly on your phone!
- Provides guard functions and state management options to autostart/stop the daemon when REST calls are initiated and/or the application is backgrounded/foregrounded
- TS Typed API for sanity.

## Disclaimer
*~~~ Beta software provided as is. I Accept no responsibility for use or misuse of Tor or this package. ~~~*

---

## Why This ?
Privacy is important and should not be hard.
- Users shouldn't be expected to install 3rd party apps and setup custom VPNS to get more privacy.
- Devs shouldn't have to jump through hoops to get Onion urls routing correctly
- React native is an awesome tool and this brings awesome privacy to it.

## What This Does ?
Embeds Tor Daemon + Onion Routing into your App, removing the dependency on Orbot and allowing Tor usage on IOS

## How it Does it ?

This module uses multiple layers:
1. Pre-compiled rust sdk (sifir-rs-sdk) for the Tor daemon and Control code (Check CODE section for details)
2. Swift/Kotlin wrappers to access and control the daemon and provide native proxified clients.
3. TS/JS Native bridges to allow access from your components.


### Requirements
- ios > 11.1
- Android minSdk > 26

### Installation

1. Install package
```sh
npm install react-native-tor
```
or
```shell script
yarn add react-native-tor
```
2. Link libs
- Android: open `android/app/build.gradle` and add
  ```
  implementation files("../../node_modules/react-native-tor/android/libs/sifir_android.aar")
  ```
- iOS:
  ```
  cd ios/
  pod install
  ```

*iOS Projects note*:
- iOS 11.1 > only: Support iOS Version is 11.1 and higher (#6)
- Bitcode not supported: Set ` Build Settings > Build Options > Enable Bitcode` to `No` for both Debug and Release.

### REST Usage Example

```js
import Tor from "react-native-tor";

// Intialize the module with some settings
const tor = Tor({
  stopDaemonOnBackground :true, // Auto shut down daemon when app in background
});
// Start and boostrap the Tor daemon returning the socksProxy port that can be
// used to direct requests to.
const socksProxy = await tor.startIfNotStarted();


try{
    // Use module built in proxied client to make a get request
    const resp = tor.get('');
} catch(error){
    // Client throws on Network errors and Response codes > 299
}
```
### Socket Usage Example

```js
import Tor from 'react-native-tor';
const tor = Tor();
await tor.startIfNotStarted()
const target = 'kciybn4d4vuqvobdl2kdp3r2rudqbqvsymqwg4jomzft6m6gaibaf6yd.onion:50001';
const conn = await tor.createTcpConnection({ target }, (data, err) => {
  if(err){
    console.error('error sending msg',err);
    return
  }
  console.log('recieved tcp msg', data);
} );


try {
  await conn.write(`{ "id": 1, "method": "blockchain.scripthash.get_balance", "params": ["716decbe1660861c3d93906cb1d98ee68b154fd4d23aed9783859c1271b52a9c"] }\n`);
  await conn.write(`{ "id": 2, "method": "blockchain.scripthash.get_balance", "params": ["716decbe1660861c3d93906cb1d98ee68b154fd4d23aed9783859c1271b52a9c"] }\n`);
  // ... moar writes
} catch (err) {
  console.error('Error SendingTcpMSg', err);
}

// Eventually when you're done and *after* recieving your data close the connection
await conn.close();
}
```
Note:
 - The current TcpStream implementation emits per line of data received. That is it reads data from the socket until a new line is reached, at which time it will emit the string line received (by calling `onData(data,null)`
     - Ergo sum the current implementation is only suited for text data that is line delineated (Electrum server, etc..)
     - Future implementations will support constant streams of buffered base64 data.
 - If an error is received, or the connection is dropped `onData` will be called with the second parameter containing the error string (ie `onData(null,'some error')`;
     - Receiving an 'EOF' error from the target we're connected to signifies the end of a stream or the target dropped the connection.
     - This will cause the module to drop the TcpConnection and remove all data event listeners.
     - Should you wish to reconnect to the target you must initiate a new connection by calling createTcpConnection again.

### Hidden Service (HS) Example (BETA)
Note: This feature is still experimental *please* do report any bugs and strange behavoir you experience.

```js
// create a new hidden service
// Accepting connections on port 20000 and forwarding the request to port 20011
const hs = await client.createHiddenService(
  20000,
  20011,

);
//
const {secretKey , onionUrl } = hs;
// Store `secretKey` ESCDA base64 private key securley so you can re-create this HS later
// secureStorage.save('key',secretKey);
// Share your OnionURl with people you want to connect to your hidden service

// Start http server with a callback to process data recieved (type HttpServiceRequest)
// or errors (This example just creates an Alert whenever an HTTP request is recieved)
const handler = client.startHttpService(
  hiddenServiceDestinationPort,
  (d, e) => {
    Alert.alert(
      `Got HTTP ${e ? 'Error' : 'Request'} `,
      `${JSON.stringify(d)} ${JSON.stringify(e)}`
    );
  })


// .. later on (once finished)
// Stop the HTTP server
handler.close()
// delete hidden service using the onionURL as it's index
client.deleteHiddenService(onionUrl);

// Restore the hidden service using the secret key you had stored!
// secretKey = secureStorage.load("key");
const hs = await client.createHiddenService(
  20000,
  20011,
  secretKey
);
// ..repeat above steps to attach an HTTP server and callback
//
```

## Development and Building from Scratch

### Building for Native projects

There are 3 layers of libraries this project relies on:
1. The [Sifir Rust SDK](https://github.com/Sifir-io/sifir-rs-sdk/)
providing lower level control of the Tor daemon and where building the iOS and Android libraries is done.
2. The [iOS](./ios) and [Android](./android) wrapper Code to bridge and provide a socks client.
This is where the mobile native code interacts with the prebuilt Rust libraries with step1 via FFI and exposes that functionality
to React. It is also where the proxied client forwards requests recieved from React.
3. The [Typescript](./src) module. This is the module React interacts with.

Depending on the level of modifications needed you will need to work with 1 or all 3 layers.

###  Building Android AAR and adding to Android Project

https://github.com/Sifir-io/sifir-rs-sdk/
Use the helper `scripts/` for both the [Android Tor](https://github.com/Sifir-io/sifir-rs-sdk/tree/main/sifir-android/) and [iOS Tor](https://github.com/Sifir-io/sifir-rs-sdk/tree/main/sifir-ios/) modules to compile them.

### Adding compiled libs to this repo
1. Copy the compiled Android AAR to the folder `./android/libs/`
2. Copy the compiled Universal iOS dylib to the folder `./ios/library/universal/`
     a. Modify [Pod spec file](./react-native-tor.podspec) if needed
3. Bootstrap and run the example app to verify all is good
     1. `yarn bootstrap`
     2. `cd example`
     3. in one terminal `yarn start`
     4. in another terminal `yarn ios` or `yarn android`

### Modify Native code

### Modify Typescript Code
